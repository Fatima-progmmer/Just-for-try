## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder Name      | Description                                      |

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

Each folder contains a `main.cpp` file. To run any program:

```bash
cd folder-name
g++ main.cpp -o program
./program
````

### Example:

```bash
cd for-loop
g++ main.cpp -o for_loop
